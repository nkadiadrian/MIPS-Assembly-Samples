# MIPS-Assembly-Samples
A collection of example tasks, with a focus on text processing and manipulation, executed with the MIPS Programming language, a very low-level language.

An example of the translation from C to MIPS can be seen in the `examples` folder.

## Running the folder
Each directory outside the `examples` and the `docs` directories corresponds to a task described in the problem set in `docs/MIPS CW.pdf`.

### Opening MARS - A MIPS Simulation IDE
To run the program the MIPS IDE in the same directory as the task must first be opened. This can be done by clicking on the `Mars4_5.jar` file but can also be done by running the following command in the terminal should need be:
```
java -jar Mars4_5.jar
```

### Executing the program
In the Mars environment the program should be selected by navigating to `File -> Open` and then selecting the file with the `.s` file extension.

Once open, navigate to `Run -> Assemble` and then run the program with `Run -> Go`.

Alternatively the program can be run step by step with `Run -> Step`.
